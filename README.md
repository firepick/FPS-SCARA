# FPS-SCARA
This repositiory is to develop a SCARA ARM solution for the FirePick.

Initial goals are:
Goal: 
(1) Produce a FPD with a SCARA arm design rather than a Rotary Delta, rationale, accuracy with Rotary Delta is very hard to achieve (in the short term)
(2) Enable true hot-swappable and hot-plug effector ends, rationale, ARM should be able to load and unload effectors without operator intervention and lots of wires and stuff attached to a variety of effectors is inefficient and a downright mess to manage (I tried to design an auto-loader for the FPD and the Rotary arms simply get in the way!)
(3) Design must be achievable with a maximum of off the shelf-parts (3d printed parts acceptable), rationale, lowest possible cost without sacrificing quality
