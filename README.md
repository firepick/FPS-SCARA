# FPS-SCARA
This repositiory is to develop a SCARA arm solution for the FirePick.

Initial goals are:

- Produce a FirePick with a SCARA arm design rather than a Rotary Delta, rationale, accuracy with Rotary Delta is very hard to achieve (in the short term)

- Enable true hot-swappable and hot-plug effector ends, rationale, the arm should be able to load and unload effectors without operator intervention and lots of wires and stuff attached to a variety of effectors is inefficient and a downright mess to manage (I tried to design an auto-loader for the FPD and the Rotary arms simply get in the way!)

- Design must be achievable with a maximum of off the shelf-parts (3d printed parts acceptable), rationale, lowest possible cost without sacrificing quality


The inspiration for this design starts with http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241491
